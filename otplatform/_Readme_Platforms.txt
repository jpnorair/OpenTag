Readme for Platforms Directory
22 Nov 2013


DEFINITION OF PLATFORMS
=======================

The Platforms Directory should be located at the path:
(PROJECT_ROOT)/otplatform

This directory should contain the following types of files, ideally grouped 
into subdirectories based on the platform-type:
1. General platform/FW libraries for computing platforms (often MCUs)
2. OpenTag-specific program code that is platform-dependent

Therefore, in OpenTag language a "platform" defines a computing platform.  A
"computing platform" implies a combination of CPU, working memory, storage 
memory, and intrinsic I/O mechanisms.  In most cases where OpenTag is deployed, 
a "computing platform" refers to a microcontroller (MCU), although it could 
also be a higher-level construct, such as POSIX.


NAMING CONVENTIONS
==================

By convention, general libraries are in subdirectories preceded with a "~"
character.  OpenTag-specific program code subdirectories are not preceeded with
any character.  The names given to these subdirectories are the platform names
themselves.

The platform names are used as subdirectories in other OpenTag directories, as
well, namely in IDE project folders and the /Board directory.  In the former,
the IDE should have a separate project for each platform it supports.  In the
latter, all boards that use the respective platform should have a board header
file stored in a subdirectory named the same as this platform.


AVAILABLE PLATFORMS
===================

At the time of writing, OpenTag supports the platforms in the table below. 
For microcontrollers, there are no other prerequistes or libraries needed, just 
what is provided in the OpenTag source tree.  For the POSIX-STDC build, you 
need a POSIX system with STD C libs.

Platform Name  | Description                    | Latest stable version
---------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------
MSP430F5       | TI MSP430F5 series MCUs        | 0.4.2
CC430          | TI CC430 series RF-MCUs        | 0.4.2
STM32F10x      | STMicro STM32F10x series MCUs  | 0.4.2
STM32L1xx      | STMicro STM32L1xx series MCUs  | 0.5
POSIX STD-C    | POSIX with STD C               | in development

Certain, special-purpose testbeds and simulators may also support POSIX as a 
platform, although they may not offer complete simulation of the OpenTag stack 
at this time.  Check with the testbed/simulator documentation.
