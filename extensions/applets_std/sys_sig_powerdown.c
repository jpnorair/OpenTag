  * @brief      Standard Sleep Routine
  *
  * Standard Sleep Routine: in the platform_xxx.h file, there should be a few
  * a few macros that control the type of sleep/power-down-mode that will be 
  * entered during different states.  The normal ones are:
  * <LI> MCU_SLEEP(): Fast wakeup, core-off, RAM alive, periperals alive </LI>
  * <LI> MCU_SLEEP_WHILE_RF(): Best sleep available during RF process </LI>
  * <LI> MCU_SLEEP_WHILE_IO(): Best sleep available during wireline IO process </LI>
  * <LI> MCU_STOP(): Best sleep available where RAM, Timer interrupt are alive </LI>
  * <LI> MCU_STANDBY(): Deep sleep, basically everything powered down </LI>
  *
  * You can write your own applet with optimized sleeping behavior for your
  * desired application.  This one should serve most apps, though.
  *
  * @note MCU_STOP() typically disables the I/O ring.  MCU_SLEEP_WHILE_RF() may 
  * also disable the I/O ring on certain platforms (particularly SoCs).  When
  * the I/O ring is disabled, any LEDs, indicators -- whatever -- will not work.
