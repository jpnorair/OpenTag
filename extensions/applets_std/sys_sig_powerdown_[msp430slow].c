  * @brief      MSP430 Slow Sleep Routine
  *
  * This powerdown routine is specific to MSP430F5 and CC430 chips.  It uses
  * LPM2 for sleeping during RF, LPM1 for sleeping during MPipe, and LPM3 for
  * sleeping whenever those things are not on.
  *
  * LPM2 puts the supply voltage monitors in a low-duty state, which saves some
  * power but causes a 100us delay on wake-up.  Hence, this is the "slow" 
  * powerdown routine because LPM2 incurs this delay.  It is not recommended 
  * for systems that must TX background packet floods or for systems that are
  * doing software-based FEC decoding.
