About demo_pongsleepy
=====================
PongSleepy is a simple, OpenTag demo application for peer-to-peer pinging 
using low-power listening mode.  The listen interval is the default 1 sec
interval, but it can be changed in main() to a different amount.


Functional purpose of this demo
===============================
 - Show a simple way how anycast queries can be used
 - Show how a command session can be initiated by a button press
 - Basic demonstration of low-power background scan & advertising


Application Description
=======================
PongSleepy is a masterless application that allows one device to send an 
advertisement followed by a query, and all the other devices respond.  It uses
the background scan feature in order to conserve energy during idle time.

The Ping is a UDP-with-inventory packet on port 255, which uses the "User ID" 
ISF to store a small cookie that qualifies devices that have the string 
"APP=PongSleepy‚Äù somewhere in that file.  Only these devices will fully process 
the Ping request and produce a Pong response.


Stock Applets Used
==================
Many of the stock applets from /otlibext/stdapplets/ are used as signal 
callbacks from the protocol layers.  You can look at extf_config.h to see which 
ones are enabled (or, to specify new ones).


This Application Recommends
===========================
(Note, MSP430 not supported yet)
CC430/MSP430F5: ~24KB Flash, ~1.5KB SRAM
Cortex M3:      ~32KB Flash, ~2KB SRAM
 - MPipe connection to show pong responses
 - Two LEDs to show RX/TX activity
 - One input source to send pings (a button), or sending by ALP over MPipe.


Supported Boards & Platforms
============================
See /apps/demo_pongsleepy/app/board_config.h for board & platform support.
NOTE: Different boards may support different methods of input and output.


Supported Project IDEs
======================
Currently, TI CCS v5 is supported for MSP430 builds (proj_ccsv5).  Raisonance 
RIDE7 is supported for Cortex M3 builds.  By the time you read this, there may
also be support for the SAT (Summon ARM Toolchain), which is a toolchain using
OpenOCD and Linaro-GCC.

Usage Notes

Compiler Constants:
This project's makefile or IDE configuration should pass several constants into
the compiler.  These constants are required for basic configuration.

__[partnum]__       (mandatory)     The part number of the platform being used.
                                    E.g. for MSP430F5529 = __MSP430F5529__, for
                                    STM32L151C8 = __STM32L151C8__.

__LITTLE_ENDIAN__   (mandatory)     Endian must be configured properly. 
__BIG_ENDIAN__                      All supported cores are __LITTLE_ENDIAN__
    
__CCSv5__           (mandatory)     Compiler must be configured properly.  
__GCC__                             RIDE and SAT both use GCC.

__RESTRICT=int      (optional)      Restricts flash allocation to lower [int]
                                    bytes.  Helpful for using low-cost tools
                                    that have code restrictions.

__LARGE_MEMORY__    (optional)      Ignored on Cortex-M.  Enables 20 bit memory
                                    addressing on MSP430X2 devices, which does
                                    incur a performance penalty.  Do not use it
                                    unless you absolutely need it.

__DEBUG__           (optional)      Enable debugging features in the code.

__PROTO__           (optional)      Enable prototyping features in the code.
                                    __DEBUG__ enables these features, too, plus
                                    more.  An example of a __PROTO__ feature is 
                                    ID generation at startup, which is not used
                                    in final products that get IDs flashed-in
                                    during manufacturing.
