  * @brief      Application Configuration File for PongLT Demo
  *
  * In your application code, you could include this file as <app/app_config.h>
  * but this is not recommended.  Instead, use:
  *
  * #include <otstd.h>
  * or
  * #include <otsys/config.h>
  *
  * As these are tested to properly bundle everything properly through the 
  * compiler.
