  * @date       31 July 2012
  * @brief      Extension Function Configuration File for Opmode Demo
  *
  * Don't actually include this.  Include OTAPI.h or OT_config.h instead.
  *
  * This include file specifies all extension functions that should be compiled
  * into the build.  Extension functions are replacements/patches for functions
  * declared in OTlib, so if you define an Extension Function (EXTF), OpenTag
  * will build and link your function instead of the regular OTlib version.
