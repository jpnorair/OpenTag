/** Low Power Mode Macros:
  * SLEEP keeps peripherals running, but turns off CPU.  Interrupts wake-up.
  * STOP turns off everything.  Only External interrupts (pins) wake-up.
  * STANDBY turns off everything and kills SRAM.  It can retain an RTC, though.
  *
  * In order to use STOP mode during OpenTag runtime, you need to make sure that
  * nothing is going on (i.e. no I/O activity), and you need to use an RTC alarm
  * for the kernel timer (GPTIM).  I haven't developed the method yet for using
  * RTC as kernel timer, but the foundation is there.  Stay tuned for v1.1.
  *
  * Use SLEEP Mode for testing purposes, and for now.
