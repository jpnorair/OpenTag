MSP430F5 Platform subdirectory:
This platform supports all MSP430F5 parts, although OpenTag is only tested to 
work with the MSP430F550x, 551x, and 552x series parts. If you are using other 
variants of the MSP430F5, you may need to change some files here and there.

The Texas Instruments MSP430F5 is a low-power microcontroller.  It is more
sophisticated than most (if not all) AVR8 and PIC 8/16 bit parts, and in my 
opinion it is better in every way than those parts.  It is also better in every
way than the MSP430F1, F2, and F4 parts that preceeded it.  If you are looking
for more computing power, the Cortex M units from STMicro, NXP, and Energy 
Micro are good examples -- the TI Stellaris is also good, but it's not as 
optimized for low power as those parts are.
