  * @author     JP Norair
  * @version    R100
  * @date       27 Nov 2012
  * @brief      Demo of Sniffer
  *
  * This demo is mostly for the purpose of testing.  It provides an RX-only
  * link.  Any of the exemplary features of this demo are made better examples
  * of in other demos.
  *
  * The default channel is 07.  You can change the listening channel using ALP
  * over MPipe.
  *
  * This Application Recommends:
  * <LI> CC430/MSP430F5: ~24KB Flash, ~1.5KB SRAM                       </LI>
  * <LI> Cortex M3: ~32KB Flash, ~2KB SRAM                              </LI>
  * <LI> MPipe connection to show pong responses                        </LI>
  * <LI> Two LEDs to show RX/TX activity                                </LI>
  * <LI> One input source to send pings (a button), or sending by ALP   </LI>
  *
  * Supported Boards & Platforms: <BR>
  * See /apps/demo_sniffer/code/platform_config.h for board & platform support.
  * @note Different boards may support different methods of input and output.
  *
  * Stock Applets: <BR>
  * Many of the stock applets from /otlibext/stdapplets/ are used as signal
  * callbacks from the protocol layers.  You can look at extf_config.h to see
  * which ones are enabled (or, to specify new ones).

/** ALP Processor Callback for Starting a Ping <BR>
  * ========================================================================<BR>
  * "ALP" is the NDEF-based set of low-level API protocols that OpenTag uses.
  * ALP messages can come-in over any communication method: wire, wireless, 
  * telepathy... anything that can transfer a packet payload.
  *
  * Some ALPs are standardized. Those get handled by OTlib automatically.  ALPs
  * that are not recognized are sent to this function to be handled.  In this
  * demo, we are using a very simple ALP, shown below:
  *
  * ALP Payload Length:         0
  * ALP Protocol ID:            255 (FF)
  * ALP Protocol Commands:      0-127 (00-7F) corresponding to channel to sniff
  *
  * The "user_id" parameter corresponds to the Device ID that sent this ALP.
  * 
  * A quickstart guide to the ALP API is available on the Indigresso Wiki.
  * http://www.indigresso.com/wiki/doku.php?id=opentag:api:quickstart
