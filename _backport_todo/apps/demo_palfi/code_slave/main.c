  * @author     JP Norair
  * @version    R100
  * @date       10 October 2011
  * @brief      PaLFi Demo Main
  *
  * This Demonstration Intends to Show:
  * <LI> Basic DASH7 features                                           </LI>
  * <LI> Using CoAP with DASH7, inside UDP Shell transport commands     </LI>
  * <LI> Interfacing OpenTag/DASH7 with a PaLFi Transponder             </LI>
  *
  * Common Variations:
  *
  * This Application Requires:
  * <LI> A TI RF430F5978 device, typically on a Fob board               </LI>
  * <LI> Minimum 32KB Flash, 2KB SRAM                                   </LI>
  * <LI> Minimum Two LEDs to show RX/TX activity                        </LI>
  * <LI> Minimum One LED to show PaLFi actions                          </LI>
  *
  * Currently Supported Boards:
  * <LI> RF430F5978 Keyfob board               </LI>
  *
  * @note
  * As there is really only one chip on the planet that can perform this demo,
  * most multi-board support code that is in other demo apps has been removed.
  * So, this would be a bad demo to use as a template unless you are developing
  * a PaLFi application, in which case it is a great template.

  * The Application button is used as an interrupt source.  For now, it also
