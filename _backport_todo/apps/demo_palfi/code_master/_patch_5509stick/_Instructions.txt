Patching the PaLFi Master Application to use the USB stick
==========================================================

Introduction
------------
TI produces and sells a USB stick (a very cool one) that includes an MCU and a
433 MHz RF frontend.  The MCU is the MSP430F5509, and the RF is a CC1101.  This
is a supported platform for OpenTag -- it is currently called the RF430 USB, or
something like that, but when TI names it officially, the name used by OpenTag
will change as well.

Patching
--------
Eventually, I will learn how to use multi-target configuration in CCS, and when
that time comes you will just pick the right target in CCS.  Until then, you
need to patch it manually.

1. Setup platform_config.h
In the file /apps/Demo_PaLFi/Code_Master/platform_config.h, make sure that the 
constant "BOARD_RF430USB_5509" is defined.  Make sure also that all other
constants with "BOARD" are commented-out.  These definitions are at the top of
this file.

2. Verify that you have the ~patch_USBstick folder in /Code_Master, and that it
contains the files: extf_code.c, app_config.h

3. Rename .../Code_Master/app_config.h to app_config.orig.h, or something like
that.  Then move the file .../Code_Master/~patch_USBstick/app_config.h into the
.../Code_Master folder.  This app_config.h is set-up for the special needs of 
the USB stick board.
