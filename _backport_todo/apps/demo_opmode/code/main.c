  * @file       /apps/demo_opmode/code/main.c
  * @author     JP Norair
  * @version    R100
  * @date       10 Oct 2012
  * @brief      Opmode Switching Demo
  *
  * Functional purpose of this demo:
  * <LI> Show differences in Gateway and Endpoint idle-time behavior </LI>
  * <LI> Switching of Operational Modes during runtime </LI>
  * <LI> Sending commands and enacting mode changes by button-press or by
  *      reception of a custom MPipe-ALP protocol that instructs OpenTag
  *      to send such commands or enact such mode-changes </LI>
  *
  * OpenTag programming examples in this demo:
  * <LI> How to put your application code into a task that gets invoked by two
  *      means: 1. Asynchronous event (button press), 2. Another task (the
  *      MPipe task, via a custom ALP command). </LI>
  * <LI> Defining a custom ALP protocol using ID=0x90, 0<=CMD<=3, and putting
  *      the custom protocol code in static callback otapi_alpext_proc() </LI>
  * <LI> Basic usage of OTAPI for logging and DASH7 dialog creation </LI>
  * <LI> Basic structuring of an OpenTag-based App & main.c </LI>
  *
  * Elements of the Demo you can customize easily (or relatively easily):
  * <LI> Easy: attach different applets to the signals by changing the applet
  *      C files in your makefile (or IDE project, in "applets" folder) </LI>
  * <LI> Pretty Easy: Change the ISF file that gets used by query or beacon,
  *      command by altering applet_send_query() or applet_send_beacon() </LI>
  * <LI> Medium: Change ISF parameters (in files 2-5) from data_default.c
  *      in order to alter the behavior of Gateway and Endpoint modes. </LI>
  *
  * This Application Recommends:
  * <LI> CC430/MSP430F5: ~24KB Flash, ~1.5KB SRAM                       </LI>
  * <LI> STM32: ~32KB Flash, ~2KB SRAM                                  </LI>
  * <LI> Minimum Two LEDs to show RX/TX activity                        </LI>
  * <LI> Two additional outputs for the application (optionally, LEDs)  </LI>
  * <LI> One input source for mode selection (optionally, a button)     </LI>
  * <LI> Two input sources for command activations                      </LI>
  *
  * Supported Boards & Platforms: <BR>
  * See /apps/demo_opmode/code/platform_config.h for board & platform support.
  * @note Different boards may support different methods of input and output.
  *
  * Stock Applets: <BR>
  * Many of the stock applets from /otlibext/stdapplets/ are used as signal
  * callbacks from the protocol layers.  You can look at extf_config.h to see
  * which ones are enabled (or, to specify new ones).

  * interrupting critical processes managed by the kernel.  In order to keep
  * OpenTag lightweight, there are not formal mutexes that protect system
  * resources.
  *
  * If "the work" has nothing to do with the OpenTag core, then you don't
  * need a task.  For example, you could just run the code from
