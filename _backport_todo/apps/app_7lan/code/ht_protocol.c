/** ALP Processor Callback for Starting a Ping <BR>
  * ========================================================================<BR>
  * "ALP" is the NDEF-based set of low-level API protocols that OpenTag uses.
  * ALP messages can come-in over any communication method: wire, wireless, 
  * telepathy... anything that can transfer a packet payload.
  *
  * Some ALPs are standardized. Those get handled by OTlib automatically.  ALPs
  * that are not recognized are sent to this function to be handled.  In this
  * demo, we are using a very simple ALP, shown below:
  *
  * ALP Payload Length:         0
  * ALP Protocol ID:            255 (FF)
  * ALP Protocol Commands:      0-127 (00-7F) corresponding to channel to ping
  *
  * The "user_id" parameter corresponds to the Device ID that sent this ALP.
  * 
  * A quickstart guide to the ALP API is available on the Indigresso Wiki.
  * http://www.indigresso.com/wiki/doku.php?id=opentag:api:quickstart

/** DASHCom Client-Server protocol <BR>
  * ========================================================================<BR>
  * DASHCom is a REST-like client-server messaging protocol that implements a
  * simple, command-oriented interface between DASH7 devices.  DASHCom is 
  * intended especially for querying applications.
  *
  * Data is packed as binary, but it may contain fields represented as text.
  * 
  * The Communication model is Template-based.  The user must first open a 
  * session using a Control Template.  Afterwards, more templates can be 
  * provided.  A typical Session might be templated as: C M QF RF
  *
  * Response data sent from server-to-client will contain a File Resource 
  * Template corresponding to the data source, followed by a Data Template.
  * 
  *
  * C: Control Template
  * <LI> Format is C:o|c|x </LI>
  * <LI> 'o' is for open, used to begin a command session.  'c' is for close, 
  *      used to terminate the current session in progress.  'x' is for execute
  *      used to initialize the command communication to the server dataset. </LI>
  * 
  * <LI> Format is F:a|b|g|l|t:addr:file:offset:length </LI>
  * <LI> Argument a, b, g, l, or t is the second byte.  'a' is antecedent mode,
  *      that is, it copies the address from the last-entered File template
  *      and "addr" is therefore 0-bytes. 'b' is broadcast mode, with 0-byte 
  *      address.  'g' is global mode with 8-byte address.  'l' is local mode 
  *      with 2-byte address.  't' is text mode, which is RFU.  </LI>
  * <LI> The address is an integer, which is binary mode is a binary value or
  *      in text mode is a hexadecimal string.  The loopback address is 0. </LI>
  
  * @note The server dataset is typically a group of external DASH7 devices.
  * 
  *
  * D: Data Template
  * <LI> Format is D::length:data </LI>
  * <LI> flags are ignored, but the byte is present in communication </LI>
  * <LI> length is a 2-byte integer </LI>
  * <LI> data is a binary bytestream </LI>
  *
  * K: Comparison File Template
  * A "File" is a binary data resource available on DASH7 devices.  Files are
  * used as input and output, which in a query relates to comparison and return.
  * This Comparison File Template should only follow a Query Template (Q).
  * <LI> Format is K:a|*:file:offset:length </LI>
  * <LI> Flags 'a' is antecedent mode, in which the file resource shall link to
  *      last-entered comparison file, and the remaining fields are not used.
  *      Any flag value other than 'a' requires the remaining fields. </LI>
  * <LI> The file path is a concatenation of block integer and file integer. 
  *      Block is 1-byte (0-3) and File is 1-byte (0-255).  In text mode, it is
  *      represented as hexadecimal text.  </LI>
  * <LI> Offset is a 2-byte integer describing a byte-offset to the resource
  *      for read/write, starting at byte 0.  </LI>
  * <LI> Length is a 2-byte integer describing resource byte access.  Using 0
  *      for Length is equivalent to using 65536, which will guarantee that the
  *      resource is accessed from the offset to its end. </LI>
  *
  * 
  * M: Media Template
  * <LI> Format is M:d:[flag-specific data] </LI>
  * <LI> The only supported flag at the moment is 'd' for DASH7.  This is a 
  *      media specifier for DASH7 media access. </LI>
  * 
  * DASH7 Media Data is a 8-byte binary payload
  * <PRE>
  * ^ DATA FIELD          ^ BYTES ^ VALUE        ^
  * +---------------------+-------+--------------+
  * | advertising channel |   1   | channel code |
  * | session channel     |   1   | channel code |
  * | subnet              |   1   | subnet code  |
  * | subnet mask         |   1   | subnet mask  |
  * | advertising timeout |   2   | integer ms   |
  * | session timeout     |   2   | integer ms   |
  * | retrieval timeout   |   2   | integer ms   |
  * </PRE>
  * 
  * 
  * Q: Query Template
  * Querying is the primary activity of DASH7 communications.  A Query Template
  * expects to be followed by a File Resource template.
  * <LI> Format is Q:a|o:!=|==|<|<=|>|>=|nn|sx:token:mask
  * <LI> Flags 'a'|'o' mean "and"|"or".  If you are doing a single query, the
  *      value doesn't matter.  If you are doing *batch queries* using multiple
  *      Query Templates in a single command, you can AND and OR this Query 
  *      with the next one.  Batch querying is a way to improve the speed of
  *      data retrieval and reduce energy expense, but it is necessary only for
  *      complex querying. </LI>
  * <LI> Comparison flags are 2-bytes, != == < <= > >= nn sx, and mostly self-
  *      explanatory.  The token should match part of the resource being
  *      queried using the chosen comparison method.  "nn" means "Non-null" and
  *      it succeeds if the resource exists at all. "sx" is a compound flag.
  *      's' means string search and 'x' is replaced with a 1-byte integer 
  *      (0-255).  x is the number of bytes/characters that can be different
  *      in the search.  0 is perfect match, 1 is one difference, etc. </LI>
  * <LI> Token is a length-value binary byte-string.  Length is one-byte, so
  *      the token is maximally 255 bytes long. </LI>
  * <LI> Mask is a length-value binary byte-string, similar to Token.  The Mask
  *      is logically ANDed onto the resource and Token data before comparison.
  *      If Mask-length is 0, mask isn't used.  If Mask-length is shorter than
  *      Token-length, the extra portion of the Token is unaffected by the mask.
  *      </LI>
  *
  *
  * R: Return File Template
  * Codify some information to return via the command.  Return Template is not
  * mandatory.  If missing, the return will be acknowledgements only.  The 
  * template is identical to the Comparison File Template (K) other than the 
  * leading 'R'
  * <LI> Format is R:a|n:file:offset:length </LI>
  *
  *
  * S: Security Template
  * Used for data authentication and encryption, RFU
  *

///      The Task "cursor" can be used for additional state control, beyond the
///      event number. </LI>
/// <LI> We give it a runtime reservation of 1 tick (it runs pretty fast).
///      This is also short enough to pre-empt RX listening, but not RX data.
///      Try changing to a higher number, and observing how the kernel
///      manages this task. </LI>

///      tasks, so giving it the max latency will prevent it from blocking
///      any other tasks. </LI>
/// <LI> We tell it to start ASAP (preemption delay parameter = 0) </LI>

/// @note The latency parameter is mostly useful for protocol management,
/// for which you probably want to enforce a request-response turnaround time.
/// for processing and for iterative tasks it is not important: set to 255.
