  * @file       /apps/demo_bgwakeup/code/main.c
  * @author     JP Norair
  * @version    R100
  * @date       27 Nov 2012
  * @brief      Demo of Background Wakeup (BG Wakeup)
  *
  * Functional purpose of this demo:
  * <LI> Show how to set up and use background advertising for wakeup </LI>
  * <LI> Show a simple way how anycast queries can be used </LI>
  * <LI> Show how a command session can be initiated by a button press </LI>
  * <LI> Provide a simple way to do link testing between a demonstration 
  *      system of two or more devices </LI>
  *
  * It is otherwise very similar to the PongLT demo.  It is a masterless 
  * application that allows one device to send a query and all the others to 
  * respond.  It does not use any sort of  power conservation measures -- all 
  * the devices are listening all the time. This is what makes it good for link 
  * testing.  It is also an incredibly simple starting point for OpenTag users.
  *
  * The Ping is a UDP-with-inventory packet on port 255, which uses the 
  * "User ID" ISF to store a small cookie that qualifies devices that have the
  * string "APP=PongLT" somewhere in that file.  Only these devices will fully
  * process the Ping request and produce a Pong response.
  *
  * This Application Recommends:
  * <LI> CC430/MSP430F5: ~24KB Flash, ~1.5KB SRAM                       </LI>
  * <LI> Cortex M3: ~32KB Flash, ~2KB SRAM                              </LI>
  * <LI> MPipe connection to show pong responses                        </LI>
  * <LI> Two LEDs to show RX/TX activity                                </LI>
  * <LI> One input source to send pings (a button), or sending by ALP   </LI>
  *
  * Supported Boards & Platforms: <BR>
  * See /apps/demo_opmode/code/platform_config.h for board & platform support.
  * @note Different boards may support different methods of input and output.
  *
  * Stock Applets: <BR>
  * Many of the stock applets from /otlibext/stdapplets/ are used as signal
  * callbacks from the protocol layers.  You can look at extf_config.h to see
  * which ones are enabled (or, to specify new ones).

  * ALP Protocol Commands:      0-127 (00-7F) corresponding to channel to ping
  *
  * The "user_id" parameter corresponds to the Device ID that sent this ALP.
