  * @brief      Informative RF terminate routine
  *
  * This applet implements a commonly used LED and logging routine that is used
  * when the System RFA Terminate callback is called.
  * In normal applications, Kernel & RF System callbacks are not terribly
  * useful, but they are good for test/debug.  The RX callback can also
  * be used to log all received frames, which can sometimes be useful,
  * or the TX callback to log all transmitted frames.  This app demos both
  * of these features.
