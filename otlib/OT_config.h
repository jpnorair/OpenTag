  * @brief      OpenTag Master Configuration Header that aggregates external 
  *             Platform & App headers.
  *
  * If the make process included some version of configuration script, it would
  * act on this file.  Therefore, this is the only file that NEEDS to be changed
  * from build-to-build, because the default setting might not match your 
  * platform or application.
