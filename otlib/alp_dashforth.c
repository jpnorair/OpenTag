// DASHForth APL processor would go here.  It does not have to do much, just
// push the applet to the VM.  I'm not sure if the directive cmd has any usage
// for DASHForth aside from the response bit.

// DASHForth manages its own user system, pusuant to the auth module, but
// independently configurable.
