  * @brief      ALP message building routines for the client.
  * @ingroup    ALP
  *
  * The functions within are intended to be used on the client side to build
  * the API message from simpler primitives.  In other words, client sends API
  * messages, server receives them and does something (whatever the API message
  * requires).
