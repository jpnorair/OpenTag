  * Like all session tasks, there is an attached applet.  The applet is a

  * The applet needs to do whatever is required to build the request frame.
  * See the applets that come with OpenTag (in /otlibext) for ideas.
  *
  * This is a good task function to use, because it is predictable.  Generally,
  * if you application is able to call this function at all, it means the
  * kernel is not blocking session creation in favor of some higher-priority
  * task (e.g. I/O drivers).  So, when you call it, the chance that for some

  * activate the session.
  *
  * The caveat of using this function is that the kernel might be engaged in a
  * higher-priority I/O task at the time the scheduling occurs.  In this case,
  * sometimes the kernel will try to run the session late and sometimes it will
  * just flush the session.  The decision of late-run/flush is dependent on the

  * A session (starting with request) always follows the advertising flood.
  *
  * Note on advertising: Advertising is a unique feature of DASH7.  Some other
  * systems so similar things, but there is no system that has as powerful a
  * method as DASH7 has.  Basic usage is to have duty = 100%.  In some regions
  * (i.e. USA) you can set duty_on/duty_off to reduce average TX power, which
  * makes long advertising durations practical even with oppressive FCC rules.
  *
  * <LI> advert_tmpl.duty_off: ticks to take a break from advertising, before
  *      resuming.  Set to 0 to enable 100% duty. </LI>

  *      ignored if duty_off == 0. </LI>
  * <LI> advert_tmpl.channel: Channel ID to do the advertising on.  The session
  *      request channel may be the same channel or a different one. </LI>
