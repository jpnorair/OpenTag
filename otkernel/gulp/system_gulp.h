  * @author     JP Norair
  * @version    V1.0
  * @date       16 October 2012
  * @brief      System Framework Definition for GULP Kernel
  * @ingroup    System
  *
  * The GULP kernel means: Global [interrupt] Ultra Low Power.  It is a good
  * kernel to use for devices with Global interrupt only (e.g. MSP430).  It is
  * also lightweight and fast, emphasizing low power over high performance. 
  * That is, it has a good scheduler for optimizing latency of critical & power
  * hungry I/O tasks, but it is not the best at maximizing CPU utilization.
  * 
  * These attributes make GULP a good choice for endpoints & subcontrollers.  
  * It is OK for simple gateways, too, for example a gateway with just an MPipe
  * interface and some simple control logic.
  *
  * If you are using a device with a more sophisticated interrupt controller,
  * such as a Cortex M3, you can use the HICCULP kernel to get virtually all
  * the same benefits as GULP, but better support for intensive multi-tasking.

/** Task Data   <BR>
  * ========================================================================<BR>
  * The kernel manages Tasks.  Each task is identified by 8 information bytes
  * and an optional dynamic callback.  This task structure is called a "marker"
  * because the task callback is not always stored inside -- if it were, then 
  * the most proper name would be "handle."  
  *
  * task_marker data elements:
  * <LI> event:     a state variable for the task.  0 = off, 1-255 = on</LI>
  * <LI> cursor:    another state variable for the task, independent of event. 
  *                 It is only affected by the scheduler, which will set to 0
  *                 on calls to sys_synchronize() </LI>
  * <LI> reserve:   number of ticks the task estimates it needs to run </LI>
  * <LI> latency:   number of ticks latency the task can afford.  If you set this
  *                 to 0, the active task will block all lower priority tasks. </LI>
  * <LI> nextevent: number of kernel clocks between present time (actually last 
  *                 kernel exit) and when the tasks expects to be serviced 
  *                 again by the kernel.</LI>
  * <LI> call:      [Optional] Task callback. </LI>
  *
  * @note When dynamic callbacks are disabled, the kernel will use a static 
  * callback method instead.  The call element, therefore, should never be used 
  * in code outside /app, for applications where the author is certain that 
  * dynamic callbacks are enabled.
