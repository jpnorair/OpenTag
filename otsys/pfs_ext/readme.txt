Memory manager: provides memory from a fixed pool that is
allocated statically at link-time.

Useful for embedded systems, where dynamic allocation is not 
always supported. Even when it is, it's sometimes safer to 
pre-allocate the memory pool and not use the heap.

Written by Eli Bendersky (eliben@gmail.com). Inspired by the 
storage allocator in "The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition"
and various allocators found online.
