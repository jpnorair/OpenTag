ADC: F0 has reduced function, is simpler, but much different

CRC: basically the same

FLASH: somewhat different, but probably inconsequential when using lib code

GPIO: Seems to be the same, except BSRR is not addressable as BSRRL, BSRRH

I2C: Very different

RTC: Basically the same, but F0 has no Alarm B and fewer backup regs

USART: Different, but probably minimal for simple UART configuration
