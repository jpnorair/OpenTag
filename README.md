About
=====
OpenTag is an open-source RTOS that implements the DASH7 standard for wireless 
sensor networking and M2M comms.  DASH7 is a wireless standard that was borne 
out of the US Military, and it is designed for *extreme* low-power and low-
latency wireless communication, so it is great for communication between moving 
things or for anything that can benefit from a lower power requirement.  DASH7 
is also designed to finally eliminate "Application Profiles" as it introduces a 
filesystem and data methodology not available to any other WSN/M2M/IoT 
standard.  Most DASH7 devices can be re-mapped over-the-air to take-on vastly 
different applications (sort of like the scene in "The Matrix" where Trinity 
learns to fly a helicopter).

OpenTag was created and is maintained by JP Norair.  Norair also invented DASH7 
during the same time, so there is a high degree of synergy between the standard 
and the implementation.  Do not be fooled by the small build size: OpenTag is a 
full-featured, real-time exokernel with a large API and library.  It is capable 
of communicating with native DASH7 peers as well as UDP, SCTP (future), and 
NDEF connections.


Supported Platforms
===================
OpenTag is designed to run on a hardware platform that includes a low-power 
microcontroller plus a 433 MHz RF transceiver.  However, much of it can also be 
compiled and run in a POSIX standard-C environment.  On the MSP430, a typical 
endpoint build might require 16-24KB ROM (Flash) and 2KB RAM.  For gateway or 
router projects, a typical MSP430 build requires 20-32KB ROM and 3-4KB RAM.  As 
a "rule of thumb," Cortex-M builds tend to use about 12% more program memory 
(flash) and 33% more RAM.  

OpenTag is increasing targeting Cortex-M as the "standard" MCU, although it 
also runs nicely on CC430, MSP430F5, MSP430F6, and RF430 devices from Texas 
Instruments.  Officially, there is no roadmap to support MCUs that are not 
Cortex-M or MSP430F5 derived.  However, OpenTag is very portable, and community 
porting efforts to other platforms are welcome.  MCUs actively supported are: 
ST STM32F10x, ST STM32L1xx, TI CC430F5/6, TI MSP430F5/6, TI RF430F5978.

The RF transceiver component for OpenTag must comply to the DASH7 requirements, 
which means that it should support GFSK and MSK modulation in the 433 MHz band. 
Transceivers that are actively supported at this time of writing are: ST 
SPIRIT1, TI CC430, TI CC110x.  Several other devices have been supported in the 
past, and many devices are suitable for use with OpenTag.


The Code
========
This is the OpenTag Mainline Distribution.  It is maintained by JP Norair, 
the creator of OpenTag and inventor of the DASH7 wireless specification.

The Haystack Distribution of OpenTag (HDO) is a superset of the mainline 
distribution, by Haystack Technologies (http://www.haystacktechnologies.com). 
HDO includes a number of features, patches, and APIs that are not available in
the mainline distribution.  Haystack tends to release one of its proprietary 
improvements back into the mainline distribution each six months.

Version History (Abridged)
==========================
The latest version is 0.5.0.  Version 2.0 is scheduled for 03.2014 release.
Version 1.x is skipped because it should have been used somewhere in the 0.2 to
0.3 timeframe.  Several proprietary stacks exist, forked from those versions.
