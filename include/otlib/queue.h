  * @brief      A module and ADT for data stream management
  * @defgroup   Queue (Queue Module)
  * @ingroup    Queue
  *
  * The queue mechanism is for storage and management of data streams. There is 
  * no facilty for dynamic queue allocation, which shouldn't be a problem given 
  * the purpose-built, embedded nature of the platform.  Even so, it wouldn't 
  * take a lot of effort to work dynamic functionality into it.

  * threaded as well as non-threaded builds of OpenTag.  However, in non-
  * threaded builds q_lock() can be inefficient and lead to unresponsiveness,
  * so it is not recommended for usage in deep parts of the kernel or drivers.
  *
  * After q_lock() returns in user-thread X, all other users (e.g. W,Y,Z) 
  * waiting for their own calls to q_lock() will keep waiting.  When user X 
  * calls q_unlock(), one of the other threads (W,Y,Z) will have q_lock() 
  * return and will have control of the queue.  This is how mutexes work.
