  * @defgroup   Queue (Queue Module)
  * @ingroup    Queue
  *
  * The queue mechanism is for storage and management of data streams. There is 
  * no facilty for dynamic queue allocation, which shouldn't be a problem given 
  * the purpose-built, embedded nature of the platform.  Even so, it wouldn't 
  * take a lot of effort to work dynamic functionality into it.
