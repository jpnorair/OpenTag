  * @brief      Register Overrides for STM32WL Lora
  * @ingroup    STM32WL_LoRa
  *
  * @todo this file is a very incomplete port from SX127x to STM32WL LoRa.
  *       It is only used right now for compiling platform tests, and it
  *       will be overhauled shortly. 
  *
  * @note within the STM32WL documentation, the LoRa & RF interface is 
  *       referred-to as "subghz".
