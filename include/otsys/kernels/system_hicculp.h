  * @version    R100
  * @date       16 January 2013
  * @brief      System Framework Definition for HICCULP Kernel
  * @ingroup    System-Kernel
  *
  * HICCULP means: Hardware Integrated Context Control, Ultra Low Power.  It is
  * more adept than GULP or Big-GULP kernels are for running parallel processes.
  * It is designed especially for the ARM Cortex M architecture, but any device
  * with similar architecture features can use HICCULP.
  *
  * HICCULP is good for systems that need multiple I/O streams.  For example,
  * you might have a device with RF, MPipe, and Ethernet, or maybe you have two
  * RF interfaces.  For these kinds of systems, GULP is going to struggle, but
  * HICCULP just laughs.  Alternatively, HICCULP is a good choice for running a
  * secondary environment above (or alongside) OpenTag, like Maple or Arduino.
  * It is possible to run a transparent implementation such an environment with
  * little-to-no changes to the environment platform.
  *
  * HICCULP is also just as power-optimized as GULP is.  The penalty on power
  * usage and system performance is negligible, because the overhead is kept in
  * the hardware domain.  The firmware overhead is only 10 instructions or so,
  * which gets more-than offset by the Cortex M 32bit ALU.

/** Task Data   <BR>
  * ========================================================================<BR>
  * The kernel manages Tasks.  Each task is identified by 8 information bytes
  * and an optional dynamic callback.  This task structure is called a "marker"
  * because the task callback is not always stored inside -- if it were, then
  * the most proper name would be "handle."
  *
  * task_marker data elements:
  * <LI> event:     a state variable for the task.  0 = off, 1-255 = on</LI>
  * <LI> cursor:    another state variable for the task, independent of event.
  *                 It is only affected by the scheduler, which will set to 0
  *                 on calls to sys_synchronize() </LI>
  * <LI> reserve:   number of ticks the task estimates it needs to run </LI>
  * <LI> latency:   number of ticks latency the task can afford.  If you set this
  *                 to 0, the active task will block all lower priority tasks. </LI>
  * <LI> nextevent: number of kernel clocks between present time (actually last
  *                 kernel exit) and when the tasks expects to be serviced
  *                 again by the kernel.</LI>
  * <LI> call:      [Optional] Task callback. </LI>
  *
  * @note When dynamic callbacks are disabled, the kernel will use a static
  * callback method instead.  The call element, therefore, should never be used
  * in code outside /app, for applications where the author is certain that
  * dynamic callbacks are enabled.
