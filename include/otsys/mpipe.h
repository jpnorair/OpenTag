  * @brief      Message Pipe (MPIPE) interface
  * @defgroup   MPipe (Message Pipe)
  * @ingroup    MPipe
  *
  * The Message Pipe is used to traffic data between a server and client.  This
  * present implementation always uses NDEF as a data wrapping format, and it
  * typically uses a wireline interface such as serial or USB CDC.
  *
  * Mpipe is a message interface, not a function-based API.  The functions in
  * the MPipe module perform MAC and I/O type features.  However, the MPipe
  * Payload is tightly coupled to NDEF, and, in OpenTag, NDEF is tightly
  * coupled to the ALP interface.  Furthermore, the ALP interface is available
  * for use as a functional API.  So, in practical terms, MPipe's purpose is as
  * a messaging API between client (e.g. PC) and server (OpenTag DASH7 device).
  *
  * To configure MPipe, alter the board configuration header file.  These are
  * found in the /board directory.  Different boards support different MPipe
  * interfaces.
  *
  * @note Mpipe Protocol
  * The Mpipe Protocol is completely implementation dependent.  Interfaces that
  * do not include an integrated MAC layer (addressing and data integrity) will
  * probably require some additional data to be sent as protocol overhead.
  * These features should be transparent to the user of Mpipe.
